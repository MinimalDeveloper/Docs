## Upcoming Docs
 1. StockBot

 - I created a "bot" that uses a stock market trading api to day trade. All with JavaScript ðŸ˜ˆ
 - Currently the bot is functional, but many tweeks that must be made, and much more learning needs to be done.

 2. WS vendor and customer portals

 - Created a portal for vendors to be able to input work times, adjust availability, message a crew coordinator, update profile information, sign legal documents through Docusign API and more.
 - Customer portal can see order details, estimates, invoices, what vendors were on am order, and give feedback on an individual vendor.
 - The documentation on this will probably take a while considering how involded these apps are.
 - Filemaker backend, VueJS front end.

 3. Access Records Through FileMaker WebDirect
 - Deprecated in a sense. However still has many important details about user access through Web Direct. Especially if you are not using a framework like VueJS
 - Documentation is essentially done. Need to add some information about how to prevent security breaches using FileMakers 'manage security'.
 - Current documentation is already on my github [here](https://github.com/MinimalDeveloper/filemaker-webdirect-record) w/o security information.

 4. ForexBot

 - Essentially will be the same as StockBot but for Forex.
 - Have not quite decided if I want to do this because I would have to learn a lot about Forex.
 - I know it can be done because if a human can trade Forex on there phone, then it can be automated.

 5. This Site!

 - This site does not have many bells and whistles, but does have many technologies that have a high learning curve.
 - How to set up dark mode (which is still a bit buggy)
 - MDX + JSX for easy Documentation
 - Deploying to Github and Netlify!
