  Hey, I'm Matt Mayfield
</h1>

Hi, my name is Matt Mayfield. I am a software developer and a minimalist by choice.

I design software that solves problems that the company I work for didn't know they had.

If you enjoy my content, support me buy fueling my coffee addiction!

## 🚀 Goal


- Documenting my journey is not only the primary goal of this site, but an essential part of supporting the community.

- Give easy to understand Javascript concepts that I personally wish I had when starting my journey as a developer

- NO ADVERTISEMENTS, NO SCAMS, NO BULLSHIT! But you can always support me by [buying me coffee](https://ko-fi.com/P5P21JZUH).

## 💫 About this site

1.  **Powered by Gatsby.**

    Entirely built using GatsbyJS! This also allows me to leverage GatsbyJS's huge ecosystem of plugins and tools. You can learn more about [GatsbyJS here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I personally highly recommend...My own guide coming soon!



2.  **Based on MDX.**

    From [mdxjs official site](https://mdxjs.com/): MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast 🚀.

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Click the edit this page on the top left corner to make changes as see fit through a pull request!


4.  **Dark Mode.**

    Added a dark mode toggle because...dark mode.

5. **Edit a page**
    If you have a Github page and see a change you want to make to any page on this site, click the pencil in the top left corner and make a pull request!

6. **Mobile First.**

7. Simple

    Simple and elegant are two things that I wanted for this site. Not too many bells and whistles.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
